1. **Event Schema Critique**: 
   - The current event types cover a broad range of interactions, but some could be redundant. For instance, "discovery" and "assumption" might overlap if discoveries often lead to assumptions. "Warning" and "blocker" might also be collapsed, as blockers are typically warnings of a higher severity. The "completion" type seems less relevant; agents generally need to know results (outcomes) rather than process milestones. An "error" event type could be useful for logging runtime issues or failures.

2. **API Ergonomics**: 
   - Posting events should minimize verbosity. Required fields should be limited to `event_type`, `content`, and `scope`. Optional fields like `confidence`, `tags`, and `references` should have sensible defaults. For querying, supporting both natural language and structured queries is beneficial, but the CLI syntax could be simplified. Consider allowing shorthand commands and auto-completion to reduce friction.

3. **The Cold Start Problem**: 
   - Briefings should prioritize recency and relevance. Providing a summary of recent changes, active blockers, and critical decisions is crucial. Offering a "compact mode" that focuses on high-impact events with links to detailed views would balance completeness and token efficiency.

4. **Cross-Agent Coordination Without MCP**: 
   - For CLI and HTTP-only agents, focus on robust file-based or webhook notifications. Agents could poll for changes or be notified via local webhooks. Ensure the CLI commands are intuitive and support batch operations to reduce the overhead of frequent polling.

5. **What Would You Actually Use?**: 
   - Essential features include conflict detection, semantic querying, and project briefing. Subscriptions and notifications would be used occasionally, especially in high-collaboration environments. Outcome tracking and lessons might be ignored initially but could become valuable for retrospective analysis. The MVP should include event posting, querying, and basic conflict detection.

6. **Failure Modes**: 
   - Implement automatic session cleanup for crashed agents to avoid stale sessions. Use rate limiting or backpressure strategies to manage fast event accumulation. For simultaneous contradictory decisions, prioritize surfacing conflicts immediately and offer a mechanism to escalate to human intervention.

7. **What's Missing?**: 
   - A mechanism for prioritizing or flagging critical events could enhance focus in busy projects. Additionally, a way to integrate with existing project management tools to sync states or decisions would enhance utility. Finally, a straightforward method for agents to request human input directly through the bus would be valuable for mixed teams.
